Hi,

This email allows you to log into GRACE, the online data collection system that we will use to mark MPs.

Your username is {{ user.get_username }}

Thatâ€™s all for now - everything else you need to know will be explained at the training session.

Any questions or queries, send them to whofundsthem@mysociety.org

Thanks for volunteering!
